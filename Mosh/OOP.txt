What is oop?
a programming paradigm centered around objects rather than functions.

Is oop a programming language/tool?
no, it is a programming style/paradigm

what are the 4 pillars of oop?
encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance

what was programming paradigm was prevelant before oop?
procedural programming paradigm

what is procedural programming paradigm?
a program written as a sequence of procedures(functions) that operate on data

what problem did oop solve from procedural?
redundency, data & functions are grouped together (that group is called an object)

instead of data/variables & functions, what are they called in oop?
properties & methods

what is an indicator a function is using procedural not oop?
function has multiple parameters

What is polymorphism?
a mechanism to refactor long control-flow statements

What is encapsulation?
a mechanism to regroup related properties & methods

What is Abstraction
a mechanism to hide the details and complexity

What is inheritance?
a mechanism to eliminate redundant code

What is an object?
a collection of key-value pairs

When is creating an object with literal syntax an issue?
when an object has behaviour (methods)

What is the solution to creating an object with literal syntax?
creating an object through a factory or constructor function

If a function returns an objects it's referred to as?
a factory function

If a function uses the 'this' keyword & 'new' operator it's referred to as?
a constructor function

Every object has a _ _ _ _ property, it references the _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __ _ _ _ _ .
constructor, function used to create the object

What is the type of a function in javascript?
an object (has properties & methods)

What are the 6 Primitives/Value Types?
Number, Boolean, String, Symbol, undefined, null

What are the 3 Reference Types?
Object, Function, Array

How are Primitives vs Objects copied?
primitives copied by value
objects    copied by reference

When to use Bracket notation when accessing a property?
property name is dynamic (configured at runtime),
name has whitespaces or special characters

What does Object.keys(your_object) return?
all keys in your_object as an Array

What can't you do with this approach "Object.keys(your_object)"?
filter out keys, all are returned

What does closure mean(in functions)?
a child function can access the parent function's variables,
even after the parent has finished executing.
